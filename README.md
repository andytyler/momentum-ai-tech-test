# Momementum Tech Task Exercise

An important data point for many of the companies we work with is are they currently using a competitor.

One of the companies more specifically wants to know is a company using Drift live chat or not.

In the project you'll find a `data` folder which contains 34 homepages of various companies, some use Drift some do not.

There is a draft endpoint here `/chat/drift`, please complete the endpoint to return an array of all the companies with a true/false of whether they are using Drift or not.

Be aware that depending on how the website has installed Drift the details you're looking for could be different.

Feels free to add packages to the project if required.
